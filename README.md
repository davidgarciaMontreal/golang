## [Code point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_point)
A **code point** or **code position** is any of the numerical values that make up the code space.

Many code points represent single characters but they can also have other meanings, such as for formatting.

The Unicode code space is divided into seventeen planes (the basic multilingual plane, and 16 supplementary planes)
* Code unit (UCS-4 encoding) any code point is encoded as 4-byte (octet) binary numbers
* In the UTF-8 encoding, different code points are encoded as sequences from one to four bytes long, forming a self-synchronizing code.
